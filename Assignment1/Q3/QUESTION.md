Build a doubly linked list to implement priority Queue. The priority of the process will be
according to given priority_level but if two processes with the same priority_level exist
in the queue then the process with least entry time will exit first.
User should be given choice to whether enter a new process into the queue or dequeue
existing process.
You may use structure “struct time” for getting system time.
