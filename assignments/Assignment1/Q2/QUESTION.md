a) Read file “infix.txt” which contains an expression. Convert this expression into postfix
expression using stack &amp; Templates and write into a file “postfix.txt”.
b) Read file “postfix.txt” which contains an expression. Convert this expression into infix
expression using stack &amp; Templates and write into a file “infix1.txt”
c) Read file “infix.txt” which contains an expression. Convert this expression into postfix
expression using stack &amp; Templates and write into a file “prefix.txt”
d) Read file “prefix.txt” which contains an expression. Convert this expression into infix
expression using stack &amp; Templates and write into a file “infix2.txt”
You need to implement the stack using singly linked list.
